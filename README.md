# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I wanted to create something that would help myself and other students learn about coding content and concepts. I also learned a lot about HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript while creating this website. I hope that it will serve as a reminder of the basics of these coding languages that I can come back to when I am stuck on something or have a question.

This prework study guide can be used to test your knowledge on various subjects within HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. It has diagrams and embedded links within to further your learning about these concepts. Also, if you open the DevTools console, you can see that basic JavaScript functions are running. There is even a "random topic" picker to help you decide what you should study!
